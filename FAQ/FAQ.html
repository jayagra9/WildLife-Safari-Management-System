                        Anytime is a good time, though the animals do tend to be closer to the road when its colder out! 
                        The animals are all on different schedules and are fed at different times throughout the day. 
                        The weather does not affect the park.

                    <p>
                        The drive through takes about 1-2 hours. 
                        The park is over 600 acres, the drive is 4.5 miles long, and we have around 100 different species.

                        Due to united states Department of Agriculture regulation, no outside food may be give to our animals.
                        Disruption of their diet may result in illness or a closure of the park.

                        jWith all there is to do and see, many visitors tell us they enjoy making a day of it! While you’re here, tour the Drive-Thru Safari as many times as you like and feed the animals from the comfort of your own vehicle. 
                        Some of our animals are more active during different times of the day, so on your second (or third) trip through, you may catch a glimpse of an animal you didn’t see the first time, watch feedings or keeper interactions with the animals, and maybe even witness the miracle of life as baby animals are born regularly!
                        Don’t miss the great photo opportunities! 
                        There’s always something new at African Safari Wildlife Park!
